# Business Model

We will focus on one main method of marketing which is paid subscription and adds.
Affiliate Marketing- Through affiliated links, our website can earn commissions when readers buy the product or services of the company
Key partners for a car selling website would include car dealerships, financing providers, insurance providers, and logistics companies.
Provide discount coupons, which will make sure that the customer will return again, even if it means we are giving a discount of very small amount.
 The cost structure for a car selling website would include the expenses associated with building and maintaining the website platform, marketing and advertising, staff salaries, and any other overhead costs.
The website should identify the channels it will use to reach its customers and promote its services. This could include online advertising, social media, email marketing, or partnerships with other websites and businesses
The primary revenue streams for a car selling website would come from commission or fees charged for every car sold through the website. This can be either a percentage of the sale price or a flat fee.
